## Install
Fetch the [latest release](https://github.com/gocruncher/jbuilder/releases) for your platform:

#### Linux

```bash
sudo wget https://github.com/gocruncher/jbuilder/releases/download/v1.0.1/jbuilder-1.0.1-linux-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/jb
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/jb
```

#### OS X brew

```bash
brew tap gocruncher/tap
brew install jb
```
#### OS X bash
```bash
sudo curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/jb https://github.com/gocruncher/jbuilder/releases/download/v1.0.1/jbuilder-1.0.1-darwin-amd64
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/jb
```

## Getting Started 

### Configure Access to Multiple Jenkins

```bash
jb set dev_jenkins --url "https://myjenkins.com" --login admin --token 11aa0926784999dab5  
```
where the token is available in your personal configuration page of the Jenkins. Click your name on the top right corner on every page, then click "Configure" to see your API token. 

In case, when Jenkins is available without authorization:
```bash
jb set dev_jenkins --url "https://myjenkins.com"  
```

or just run the following command in dialog execution mode:
```bash
jb set dev_jenkins
```


### Shell autocompletion

As a recommendation, you can enable shell autocompletion for convenient work. To do this, run following:
```bash
# for zsh completion:
echo 'source <(jb completion zsh)' >>~/.zshrc

# for bash completion:
echo 'source <(jb completion bash)' >>~/.bashrc
```
if this does not work for some reason, try following command that might help you to figure out what is wrong: 
```bash
jb completion check
```

### Examples
```bash
# Configure Access to the Jenkins
jb set dev-jenkins

# Start 'app-build' job in the current Jenkins
jb run app-build

# Start 'web-build' job in Jenkins named prod
jb run -n prod web-build

# makes a specific Jenkins name by default
jb use PROD  
```

## Futures
- cancellation job (Ctrl+C key)
- resize of the output (just press enter key)
- output of child jobs   

## Useful packages
- [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) - library for creating powerful modern CLI
- [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) â€“ Terminal string styling done right
- [bar](https://github.com/superhawk610/bar) - Flexible ascii progress bar.

## Todos
- add authorization by login/pass and through the RSA key
